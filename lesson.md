## Part 2 - SCRUM

SCRUM is one of the many Agile Methodologies.

SCRUM Theory:
Empricism through:
1. Transparency - Giving visibility to processes 
1. Inspection - Timely checks of progress
1. Adaptation - Adjusting the process as needed

Scrum Values:
1. Courage - We admit we do not know everything 
1. Focus - focus on what is important
1. Commitment - dedicated to delivering quality software
1. Respect - create cross-functional, self-organizing teams
1. Openness - frequently inspecting through delivery

A Scrum team is composed of:
1. Product Owner - Manages the Product Backlog and optimizes the value of the Product
1. Scrum Master - Manages the Scrum process and removes impediments
1. Development Team - Manages itself and create increments based on Definition of Done

In SCRUM, there are four meetings:

1. *Sprint Planning* - Laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. (4 to 8 hours)
1. *Daily Scrum* - Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal. (15 mins)
1. *Sprint Review* - Inspect the outcome of the Sprint. (1 to 4 hours)
1. *Sprint Retrospective* - Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. (1 to 3 hours)

### Activity - Research
What are the use of each Scrum artifacts:
Scrum artifacts are key tools in Agile software development. Here's a brief explanation of each:
1. **Product Backlog**: This is a prioritized list of all the potential features, improvements, and fixes for the product. It's maintained by the Product Owner and it's dynamic, meaning items can be added, removed, or reprioritized as needed.
1. **Sprint Backlog**: This is a subset of the Product Backlog that the team commits to complete during the next Sprint (a time-boxed iteration, typically 2-4 weeks). The team owns the Sprint Backlog and can adjust it during the Sprint as necessary.
1. **Product Increment**: This is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Teamâ€™s definition of "Done", regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.
