## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing Scrum will definitely improve the productivity of your startup IT team. This is because Scrum is an Agile framework that promotes collaboration, flexibility and transparency, which are crucial for a fast-paced startup environment.

First, Scrum encourages iterative progress and continous feedback. The team can deliver work in small, manageable increments, which allows them to adapt to changes quickly. This is beneficial for startups where requirements can change frequently.

Second, Scrum promotes transparency and communcation via regular scrum meetings (like daily stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospectives). This ensure every team member is on the same page about what is being worked on and challenges faced by others. This can lead to quicker problem-solving, and less time wasted on miscommunications.

Finally, Scrum prioritizes work to help the team focus on the most valueble tasks first. This ensures the team is always working on what's most important for the business, which leads to more efficient use of time and resources.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a **user**, I want to **search for books by title, author or ISBN number**, so that **I can find the book I'm looking for easily**.
2. As a **user**, I want to **reserve a book that is currently borrowed**, so that **I can be next in line when it's returned**.
3. As a **user**, I want to **renew the borrowing period of a book**, so that **I have longer time to read it**.
4. As a **user**, I want to **receive reminders when my borrowed book is due**, so that **I can return it before the due date**.
5. As a **user**, I want to **view my borrowing history**, so that **I can keep track of the books borrowed previously**.
6. As a **librarian**, I want to **add new books to the library's inventory**, so that **users can checkout the latest addition**.
7. As a **librarian**, I want to **update the status of books (available, borrowed, reserved) automatically**, so that **the system accurately reflects the current state of the inventory**.
8. As a **librarian**, I want to **view users borrowing history**, so that **I can make recommendations based on their reading habits**.
9. As a **librarian**, I want to **send reminders to users who have overdue books**, so that **the books can be returned and prevent excessive overdue fines**.
10. As a **librarian**, I want to **manage reservations for books**, so that **I can ensure a fair and efficient system for users who want to borrow popular books**.
